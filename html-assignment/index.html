                    Hello, nice to meet you who are reading this page. My name is <em> TingyuRuan</em> and I'm from
                    <strong>China</strong>. Of course, you are welcome to call me by my English name, <em>Nathan</em>.
                    And I
                    am currently learning how to design a popular web page in my hometown, China. I hope we can become
                    friends.

                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born in <b>1999</b>, Oct 3<sup>th</sup> is my birthday.As a child who grew up with books.
                        I really enjoyed sharing the stories and ideas I knew with my friends. As the years passed, I
                        began to think: why not share what I know and enjoy with more people through a new type of
                        <b>media</b>? And that's why I chose to study this program.
